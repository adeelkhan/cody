// SetSize resizes the pane. Resizing the underlying pty/emulator is a real
// syscall/state change, so it only happens when the size actually changed
// — this makes it safe to call every render frame (matching the pattern
// already used for the editor/tree panes) without spamming the child
// process with spurious resize notifications on every keystroke.
//
// width/height are clamped to >= 0 here rather than trusted from the
// caller: an aggressive window resize can drive the app's computed pane
// width negative (see app.Model's WindowSizeMsg handling), and the real
// vt.Emulator's Resize panics on a negative slice bound instead of
// degrading gracefully — this package can't rely on every caller getting
// the arithmetic right upstream, the same way editor/filetree already
// floor their own content width before using it.
//
// Any resize that changes width, height, or both runs one unified
// computation, protecting BOTH dimensions in the same call — a
// corner-drag (both dimensions changing on every intermediate step,
// which is how dragging a window corner actually behaves, not a rare
// edge case) needs its width protected exactly as much as a single-edge
// drag does, and an earlier version of this function that skipped width
// protection whenever height also changed left that gap wide open
// (confirmed by reproducing real truncation through it).
//
// ultraviolet's Buffer.Resize implements a width shrink as
// `Lines[i] = Lines[i][:width]` for every row — permanently truncating
// anything past the new column count, with no reflow of its own (the
// library has no per-row soft-wrap tracking to reflow from — confirmed
// directly in its source, and empirically against real terminals like
// tmux and Ghostty that DO reflow and don't lose this content) — and a
// height shrink as `Lines = Lines[:height]`, keeping the TOP rows and
// discarding the rest with no capture of its own. Both are corrected the
// same way: capture the old grid's rows and cursor before the library's
// own resize call, reflow them at the new width if width changed
// (reflowRows in reflow.go — a no-op pass-through if width didn't
// change), and write the result back afterward (writeReflowedRows)
// — which already erases every row it touches, so whatever the
// library's own resize did to cell content along the way is fully
// overwritten regardless of which dimension(s) changed.
//
// writeReflowedRows evicts whatever doesn't fit the new height into
// shrinkOverflow, oldest first, always keeping the NEWEST rows
// (including whichever holds the cursor) live — see its own doc
// comment. This one direction now covers a pure width change, a pure
// height change, and both together, replacing what used to be two
// separate mechanisms (a height-only capture with its own
// gesture-tracking flag, and a width-only reflow) that each only
// protected one dimension and, in the height-only path's case,
// evicted the wrong end of the grid — a workaround for the library's
// own resize always keeping the top, which no longer constrains
// anything once writeReflowedRows unconditionally overwrites the grid
// afterward regardless.
//
// This runs unconditionally on every resize call, recomputing fresh
// from the CURRENT grid every time — there is no snapshot to go stale,
// no "is this still the same gesture" tracking needed, which is what
// makes a real multi-step drag (many small SetSize calls, one per
// intermediate size the OS reports) and a single big jump covering the
// same total resize naturally produce identical results.
//
